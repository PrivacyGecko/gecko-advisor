# Project History

This repository represents the complete development history of Gecko Advisor, spanning from September 2025 to present.

## Timeline

**September 18, 2025**: Initial development began in private repository
**October 27, 2025**: Code transitioned to public open-source repository
**November 2, 2025**: Git history migrated to show complete development timeline

## Migration Notes

The git history was migrated from a private development repository to provide transparency about the project's authentic development journey. All code changes and technical commits are preserved exactly as they occurred. Commit message metadata related to development tooling has been cleaned for clarity.

**What Was Changed:**
- AI coding assistant attribution footers removed from commit messages
- Sensitive environment files removed from git history (test API keys)
- All code, features, and technical commits preserved intact

**What Was Preserved:**
- Complete 2-month development timeline (Sept 18 → Nov 2, 2025)
- All 279 commits with original dates and authors
- Every code change, feature addition, and bug fix
- Complete project evolution and decision history

## Development Approach

Gecko Advisor is built with modern development practices including:
- Test-driven development (100+ E2E tests)
- Continuous integration/deployment
- Code review and pull request workflows
- Open collaboration and transparency

For more details, see CLAUDE.md for development guidelines.

## Authenticity

This repository shows the real, unfiltered development process of building a privacy scanning tool over 2+ months. The timeline reflects:
- Initial architecture decisions (September)
- Feature development and iterations (October)
- Open-source preparation and cleanup (November)
- Ongoing development and improvements

Every commit represents actual work done to build and improve Gecko Advisor.
