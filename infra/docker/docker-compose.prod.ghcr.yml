# Docker Compose override for production environment using pre-built GHCR images
# This eliminates on-server builds and resolves disk space issues
#
# Usage in Coolify:
# 1. Set COMPOSE_FILE=infra/docker/docker-compose.yml:infra/docker/docker-compose.prod.ghcr.yml
# 2. Configure GitHub Container Registry authentication
# 3. Deployments will pull pre-built images from GitHub Actions
