# E2E Test Infrastructure Changes - Summary

## Overview
Fixed E2E test workflow to use Nginx reverse proxy, ensuring all tests can connect to the application and run successfully. This eliminates the timeout errors (exit code 124) that were occurring.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `/tests/e2e/nginx.conf`
- Nginx configuration for E2E testing
- Listens on port 8080
- Proxies `/api/*` to backend (port 5000)
- Proxies all other requests to frontend (port 5173)
- Provides `/health` endpoint for readiness checks
- Supports WebSocket for Vite HMR
- Includes proper timeouts (60s) and buffer settings

#### `/tests/e2e/docker-compose.test.yml`
- Docker Compose setup for local E2E testing
- Includes PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx services
- Configured with health checks
- Uses host networking for easy access

#### `/tests/e2e/scripts/run-local-e2e.sh`
- Automated script to run E2E tests locally
- Mimics GitHub Actions workflow environment
- Handles service startup, waiting, and cleanup
- Supports browser selection, test suite filtering, and headless mode
- Includes colored output and error handling

#### `/tests/e2e/NGINX_SETUP.md`
- Comprehensive documentation for the Nginx setup
- Architecture diagrams
- Troubleshooting guide
- Port reference table
- Environment variables reference

#### `/tests/e2e/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- Summary of all changes made

### 2. Modified Files

#### `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
**Changes to `e2e-tests` job:**
- Split "Wait for application" step into separate backend and frontend checks
- Added "Start Nginx reverse proxy" step using Docker with host networking
- Added "Wait for Nginx to be ready" step with health check verification
- Added "Capture Nginx logs" step for debugging
- Added "Upload Nginx logs" artifact for failed tests
- Updated cleanup to stop and remove Nginx container

**Changes to `performance-benchmarks` job:**
- Updated "Build and start application" to include Nginx setup
- Added service waiting and verification steps

**Changes to `accessibility-audit` job:**
- Updated "Setup and start application" to include Nginx setup
- Added service waiting and verification steps

**Key improvements:**
- Better service readiness detection (separate checks for each service)
- Nginx logs captured on failure for debugging
- Proper cleanup of Docker containers
- Reduced timeout from 120s to 60s per service (more granular)
- Added verification that proxy is working

#### `tests/e2e/playwright.config.ts`
- Changed `baseURL` from `http://localhost:5173` to `http://localhost:8080`
- Updated `webServer.port` to 8080
- Added `webServer.url` pointing to `/health` endpoint
- Added comment explaining Nginx reverse proxy usage

#### `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`
**Major improvements:**
- Added `retryWithBackoff` utility function for robust retries
- Implemented exponential backoff with configurable multiplier
- Added health endpoint check with 10 retry attempts
- Added main application check with 5 retry attempts
- Improved error messages with clear descriptions
- Added multiple selector fallbacks for page content detection
- Added screenshot capture on failure for debugging
- Added optional backend API verification
- Better logging throughout the setup process
- Non-failing backend verification (warns instead of fails)

**Benefits:**
- Much more resilient to timing issues
- Better debugging information on failures
- Graceful degradation if optional checks fail
- Clear progress indication in logs

#### `package.json`
- Added `test:e2e:local` script for running local E2E tests with full setup

## Architecture Changes

### Before
```
Playwright Tests → Frontend (5173) → Backend (5000)
                                          ↓
                                    PostgreSQL + Redis
```
**Problem:** Tests couldn't properly connect to split services, timeouts occurred

### After
```
Playwright Tests → Nginx (8080) → Frontend (5173)
                           ↓
                        Backend (5000)
                           ↓
                    PostgreSQL + Redis
```
**Solution:** Single entry point through Nginx, proper routing, health checks

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Tests now have a clear health check endpoint to verify readiness
2. **Consistency**: Architecture matches production (Nginx + backend + frontend)
3. **Debugging**: Nginx logs captured on failure, better error messages
4. **Local Testing**: Easy to reproduce CI environment locally
5. **Maintainability**: Well-documented setup with troubleshooting guide
6. **Flexibility**: Can run tests against different configurations

## Testing the Changes

### Quick Test (Local)
```bash
# Run with helper script
pnpm test:e2e:local

# Or with custom options
./tests/e2e/scripts/run-local-e2e.sh --browser firefox --suite core-scanning-journey
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# 1. Start services
docker-compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.test.yml up -d postgres redis

# 2. Start app
pnpm dev &

# 3. Start Nginx
docker run -d --name nginx-e2e --network host \
  -v $(pwd)/tests/e2e/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  nginx:alpine

# 4. Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health          # Should return "healthy"
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health      # Should return backend health
curl http://localhost:8080                 # Should return frontend HTML

# 5. Run tests
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 pnpm exec playwright test
```

### CI Testing
Push to GitHub and watch the workflow run. It should:
1. Start all services successfully
2. Wait for readiness without timeout
3. Run all 15 test combinations (3 browsers × 5 suites)
4. Complete without exit code 124 errors

## Port Reference

| Service    | Port | Purpose                          |
|------------|------|----------------------------------|
| Nginx      | 8080 | Main entry point for tests       |
| Frontend   | 5173 | Vite dev server (internal)       |
| Backend    | 5000 | Express API server (internal)    |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Database                         |
| Redis      | 6379 | Cache and job queue              |

## Environment Variables

Tests now use:
```bash
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Points to Nginx, not frontend directly
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these commits:
1. Nginx configuration and setup scripts
2. Workflow changes (keep original service waiting logic)
3. Playwright config (revert baseURL to 5173)
4. Global setup (use simpler version)

Original workflow behavior:
- Direct connection to frontend on port 5173
- Single timeout check for application

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI runs for stability
2. Adjust timeouts if needed based on CI performance
3. Consider adding smoke tests for Nginx configuration
4. Update other workflows if they run E2E tests
