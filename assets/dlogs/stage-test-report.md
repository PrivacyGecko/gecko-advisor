## ❌ Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Rate Limiting on Scan Status Endpoint (429 Errors)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Scan functionality degraded

**Details:**
- Frontend polls `/api/scan/{id}/status` too aggressively
- After ~14 successful requests (200 OK), server starts returning 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Rate limiter blocks further requests temporarily
- Eventually recovers, but scan UX is severely impacted
- Error message shown: "Scan encountered an error"

**Evidence:**
```
[GET] /api/scan/cmgemrhad0000jb3n3gfpni8z/status => [200] (×14)
[GET] /api/scan/cmgemrhad0000jb3n3gfpni8z/status => [429] (×30+)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Polling interval appears to be ~1 second or less
- Rate limiter configuration too restrictive for status polling
- No exponential backoff or retry logic on frontend

**Recommendation:**
1. Increase polling interval to 2-3 seconds
2. Implement exponential backoff on 429 responses
3. Adjust rate limiter to allow more frequent status checks (or exclude status endpoint)
4. Add better error handling UI instead of generic "error encountered"

---

### Issue 2: Report Endpoint Returns 502 Bad Gateway
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cannot view any existing scan reports

**Details:**
- All report links from "Recent Reports" fail to load
- Backend returns HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway)
- Tested reports:
  - `/r/1gKJj_` (x.com) - 502 error
  - `/r/NB0V1E` (example.com) - 502 error
  - `/r/6_YC2I` (privamule.com) - Not tested but likely same issue
- Frontend shows: "Report Not Found" error page

**Evidence:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 ()
@ https://stage.privamule.com/api/report/...
```

**Root Cause:**
- Backend service (or upstream service) not responding
- Possible database connection issue
- Possible backend/worker service crash or misconfiguration
- Could be Prisma client issue or database query timeout

**Recommendation:**
1. Check backend service logs immediately
2. Verify database connectivity and health
3. Check Prisma client initialization
4. Review report endpoint implementation for errors
5. Add health check monitoring for report endpoint
6. Consider implementing circuit breaker pattern

### Issue 3: Permissions-Policy Header Parse Error
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Browser console warnings, no functional impact

**Details:**
- Consistent console error on every page load
- Error: "Parse of permissions policy failed because of errors reported by structured header parser"
- Appears to be Nginx configuration issue

**Evidence:**
```
[ERROR] Error with Permissions-Policy header: Parse of permissions policy failed
because of errors reported by structured header parser. @ :0
```

**Root Cause:**
- Malformed Permissions-Policy header in Nginx configuration
- Likely syntax error in CSP or permissions policy directive

**Recommendation:**
1. Review Nginx configuration for Permissions-Policy header
2. Validate header syntax using online validators
3. Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy
4. Fix syntax or remove invalid directives

## Test Coverage

### Tested Functionality ✓
- [x] Landing page load
- [x] URL scan submission
- [x] Scan progress UI (partial - blocked by rate limiting)
- [x] Tab switching (URL/APP/ADDRESS)
- [x] Navigation links
- [x] Footer links
- [x] About page
- [x] Docs page
- [x] Report viewing (failed - 502 errors)

### Not Tested
- [ ] Successful scan completion (blocked by rate limiting)
- [ ] Report detail view (blocked by 502 errors)
- [ ] Share report functionality
- [ ] Admin endpoints
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Accessibility (WCAG compliance)

---

## Network Analysis

### Successful Requests
- Frontend assets: All loaded successfully (200 OK)
- Recent reports API: Working (200 OK)
- Scan submission: Working (202 Accepted)
- Initial status polls: Working for ~14 requests

### Failed Requests
- Status polling: 429 after threshold reached
- Report retrieval: 502 Bad Gateway for all reports

---

## Recommendations Priority

### P0 (Immediate - Blocking Production)
1. **Fix 502 Bad Gateway on report endpoint** - Core functionality broken
   - Check backend service status
   - Review error logs
   - Verify database connectivity

2. **Fix rate limiting on status endpoint** - Scan UX severely degraded
   - Increase polling interval
   - Adjust rate limiter configuration
   - Add exponential backoff

### P1 (High - Should Fix Before Release)
3. **Fix Permissions-Policy header** - Clean console, proper security headers
   - Review and fix Nginx configuration

### P2 (Medium - Post-launch)
4. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. Implement health check dashboard
6. Add monitoring and alerting for 502/429 errors
7. Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time scan updates (eliminates polling)

---

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix report 502 errors immediately
2. Adjust rate limiting or polling logic
3. Re-test all functionality after fixes
4. Run accessibility and performance tests
5. Conduct cross-browser testing
6. Plan load testing for production readiness
