## üìà Phase 2 Readiness Preview

Phase 2 features (analytics, improved caching, storage pruning) are **not yet implemented** but have clear infrastructure dependencies:

### Phase 2 - Growth (Month 2-3)

| Feature | Code Status | Infrastructure Status |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Plausible Analytics** | ‚ùå Not Implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires DPA + Privacy Policy update |
| **Improved Caching** | üü° Partial (Redis exists) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs TTL tuning + Cloudflare edge rules |
| **Job Queue Optimization** | üü° Partial (backpressure exists) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs concurrency limits |
| **Storage Pruning** | ‚úÖ Ready (lifecycle rules) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs 30-day policy verification |
| **CI/CD Refinement** | üü° Partial | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs artifact retention policy |

---

## üí∞ Estimated Monthly Costs (Phase 1)

Based on current implementation and infrastructure plan:

| Service | Monthly Cost | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **CCX21 Server (Hetzner)** | ‚Çπ3,500 - ‚Çπ4,000 | ‚úÖ Provisioned |
| **Cloudflare (Free Tier)** | ‚Çπ0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending setup |
| **UptimeRobot Pro** | ‚Çπ600 - ‚Çπ900 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending setup |
| **Hetzner Object Storage** | ‚Çπ1,500 - ‚Çπ2,500 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending setup |
| **Total (Phase 1)** | **‚Çπ5,600 - ‚Çπ7,400** | |

**Note:** Excludes optional services (Plausible, IP-Intel API) planned for Phase 2-3.

---

## üéØ Launch Timeline Recommendation

**Estimated Time to Launch:** 3-4 hours of focused setup work

### Day 1 (Setup - 3-4 hours)
- **Hour 1:** Cloudflare DNS, SSL, CDN, WAF, Turnstile widget
- **Hour 2:** Hetzner Object Storage bucket, lifecycle policy, credentials
- **Hour 3:** UptimeRobot Pro monitors, alert configuration
- **Hour 4:** Environment variable deployment, smoke testing

### Day 2 (Validation - 2 hours)
- Monitor UptimeRobot for 24 hours
- Verify Turnstile is blocking bots
- Confirm reports are being archived
- Check Grafana metrics for anomalies

### Day 3+ (Soft Launch)
- Announce to limited audience (Twitter, Product Hunt preview)
- Monitor queue depth, CPU, memory via Grafana
- Adjust rate limits if needed
- Prepare Phase 2 features based on real usage data

## üîç Key Technical Decisions

### Object Storage Architecture
**Decision:** Use S3-compatible object storage with graceful degradation
**Rationale:**
- Reduces database size and backup costs
- Scales storage independently from compute
- Lifecycle policies automate 30-day retention
- Graceful fallback ensures service continuity during outages

**Implementation:** Reports are stored to object storage by worker after scan completion. Backend retrieves via signed URLs (if private bucket) or public CDN URLs (if public bucket with CDN enabled).

### Turnstile Integration
**Decision:** Apply only to `/api/v2/scan` endpoints, gracefully pass-through when disabled
**Rationale:**
- Protects highest-cost operation (scanning) without blocking legitimate traffic
- Allows local development without Cloudflare dependency
- Reduces false positives on read-only endpoints (reports, status)

**Implementation:** Middleware checks for token in body or headers, verifies with Cloudflare API, logs failures, returns RFC7807 errors on verification failure.

### Intelligent Rate Limiting
**Decision:** Dynamic limits based on complexity + queue backpressure
**Rationale:**
- Simple scans (static sites) don't need same protection as complex scans (SPAs)
- Queue backpressure prevents overload during traffic spikes
- Per-scan status polling allows UI to poll without hitting global limits

**Implementation:** Rate limiter calculates final limit = baseLimit √ó complexityMultiplier √ó loadAdjustment. Complexity determined by URL structure, force flag, and domain. Load adjustment queries queue metrics (cached 30s) and reduces limits when pending jobs exceed threshold.

---

## üìù Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Launch)
1. **Complete infrastructure setup** following `assets/docs/operations/phase-1.md`
2. **Test end-to-end flow** with Turnstile enabled on staging environment
3. **Verify UptimeRobot alerts** are routing to correct Telegram/email
4. **Document production credentials** in secure password manager

### Week 1 Post-Launch
1. **Monitor queue depth** and adjust `SCAN_CONCURRENCY` if needed
2. **Review rate limit logs** and adjust complexity multipliers if too aggressive
3. **Validate object storage costs** against projection (‚Çπ1,500-‚Çπ2,500/month)
4. **Set up Grafana alerts** for CPU >80%, memory >80%, queue depth >50

### Month 1 Post-Launch
1. **Review UptimeRobot data** and calculate actual uptime %
2. **Analyze Cloudflare WAF logs** to tune bot protection rules
3. **Plan Phase 2 features** based on real usage patterns
4. **Evaluate need for IP-Intel API** based on abuse patterns

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**The codebase is production-ready for free product launch.** All Phase 1 features have been implemented with production-grade error handling, logging, and graceful degradation.

**Infrastructure setup is the only remaining blocker.** Following the operational checklist in `assets/docs/operations/phase-1.md` will complete the launch preparation.

**Estimated launch readiness:** 3-4 hours of infrastructure setup + 24 hours of monitoring validation.
