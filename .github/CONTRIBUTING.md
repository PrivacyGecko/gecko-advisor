## Commit Message Guidelines

### ‚ùå DO NOT Include AI Attribution

**Never** include AI tool references in commit messages:
- No "Generated with Claude Code"
- No "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- No robot emojis (ü§ñ) with AI references

### ‚úÖ DO Write Clean Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Example:**
```
fix(e2e): Correct test suite grep patterns to match actual test names

The E2E tests were failing because the --grep patterns in the workflow
didn't match the actual test.describe() names in the test files.

Fixed mappings:
- "core-scanning-journey" ‚Üí "Core Privacy Scanning Journey"
- "performance-validation" ‚Üí "Performance Validation"
```

## Pre-commit Hook

A git hook is installed that will **automatically reject** commits containing Claude references. If you see an error when committing, remove the AI attribution lines from your commit message.
